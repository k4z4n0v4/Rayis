2020-02-19 13:52:38	xDark	@algiuxas look in your HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Magnet\shell\open\command
2020-02-19 13:52:49	xDark	EDIT: @algiuxas nvm
2020-02-19 13:52:52	xDark	Disregard that
2020-02-19 13:53:06	xDark	I will point you to a source as soon as im done with my class
2020-02-19 13:54:19	algiuxas	I am very confused how it is even possible for web page to communicate with OS programs or however it works, even in incognito
2020-02-19 13:56:20	xDark	Take a look at the link it calls.
2020-02-19 13:56:38	xDark	Does it start with http or https like a normal link?

2020-02-19 13:56:54	xDark	Im trying to remember what these are called
2020-02-19 13:57:09	xDark	But I’m too focused on my class rn to think properly
2020-02-19 13:58:33	algiuxas	http://127.0.0.1:6463/?v=1
2020-02-19 13:58:33	algiuxas	ooooh that explains it all
2020-02-19 13:59:10	algiuxas	I wonder if that's abusable
2020-02-19 14:00:00	algiuxas	probably not

2020-02-19 18:13:11	Yonatan	Windows is shit
2020-02-19 18:13:17	Pyro57	I have to fight windows every step of everythign I try to do
2020-02-19 18:13:29	xDark	Nah, It’s fluid. Easy to deal with.
2020-02-19 18:13:33	Pyro57	hell I have a hard time getting my fiance's HEADPHONE jack working
2020-02-19 18:13:35	xDark	Install it once, and forget about it.
2020-02-19 18:13:41	Pyro57	HEADPHONES you should just plug em in
2020-02-19 18:13:42	Yonatan	Any OS recommendations anyone?
2020-02-19 18:13:43	Pyro57	buuut noooo
2020-02-19 18:13:47	xDark	@Pyro57 disable the surround sound setting

2020-02-19 18:13:50	Pyro57	arch + tiling WM works for me
2020-02-19 18:13:58	xDark	I had that problem with the headphone jack
2020-02-19 18:14:07	xDark	Sorry spatial sound*
2020-02-19 18:14:12	xDark	Disable spatial sound
2020-02-19 18:14:44	Pyro57	that's what I ended up having to do... but for real every little thing I try to do in windows fights me
2020-02-19 18:15:00	Pyro57	take my work laptop home to plug into my screen to work from home and now I need a driver for it
2020-02-19 18:15:02	xDark	Took some fiddling, but thats all due to how Microsoft downsized and eliminated the testing department
2020-02-19 18:15:03	Pyro57	on linux it just works
2020-02-19 18:15:09	Yonatan	Windows fucked up so many of my hardware hacking stuff
2020-02-19 18:15:14	Yonatan	Killed my malduino
2020-02-19 18:15:18	xDark	Homie

2020-02-19 18:16:11	Yonatan	One time it just overwritten my MBR
2020-02-19 18:16:12	Pyro57	plus windows defaults are HORRIBLE for security
2020-02-19 18:16:30	Pyro57	first user you set up is an admin and it doesn't ask you to create a standard??
2020-02-19 18:16:33	Yonatan	On my school computer I had to install Win10Privacy
2020-02-19 18:16:55	Yonatan	After having to do a lot of privesc shit
2020-02-19 18:17:03	xDark	:lulWut: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/568437486666121217.png> you still have to go through the UAC to perform any admin tasks tho
2020-02-19 18:17:08	xDark	The prompt thingy
2020-02-19 18:17:13	Yonatan	Yeah I know
2020-02-19 18:17:26	Yonatan	I used a UAC bypass back then
2020-02-19 18:17:28	Pyro57	right cause bypassing that isn't possible... and if I have RDP or gui access clicking yes is so hard
2020-02-19 18:17:43	Pyro57	shoud have to right click run as different user and type a password
2020-02-19 18:17:48	Pyro57	that's the best way to set it up
2020-02-19 18:18:08	Yonatan	What distro do you guys use?
2020-02-19 18:18:23	Pyro57	but it doesn't even tell you that in the install... like at least makign users aware that's the best way would be nice

2020-02-19 20:06:37	xDark	@long_live_eswatini VHDL is more verbose and better in my opinion than Verilog. VHDL is more used by governments and commercial companies world wide. While Verilog is mostly used in commercial companies in the US.

2020-02-19 21:50:32	ᑕᒪOᗩK	*Question* Could the middle of a star topology be anything that gives off a connection? Is that what it is?
2020-02-19 21:50:43	yyyyy	@Hez come to socal and work DoD
2020-02-19 21:51:19	Hez	not gonna lie, I legit thought about military work, like AirForce or some shit. That's how low I've stooped hahahha
2020-02-19 21:51:19	yyyyy	@ᑕᒪOᗩK I think having a central hub is pretty important to the definition of a star network
2020-02-19 21:51:32	Hez	and California's cost of living
2020-02-19 21:51:34	Hez	jeebus
2020-02-19 21:51:42	yyyyy	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2020-02-19 21:52:09	yyyyy	Cloak, good to keep in mind that hubs basically just pass on all of the traffic they get, so every 'spoke' of the star gets traffic passed to the hub
2020-02-19 21:52:12	ᑕᒪOᗩK	Wait, hubs are old and not used anymore . But then star topologies are used nowadays so will I note that the central device is usually a hub?
2020-02-19 21:52:27	yyyyy	Hubs are old but definitely still used
2020-02-19 21:52:46	yyyyy	any technology that you think is old is still used somewhere
2020-02-19 21:52:56	ᑕᒪOᗩK	But I searched it up and It said It could be a hub switch router modem
2020-02-19 21:53:08	ᑕᒪOᗩK	I don't understand
2020-02-19 21:53:14	Hez	probably only thing keeping me here, and in the city anyway is friends and having the shit to do. But living closer to family would be nice
2020-02-19 21:53:22	ᑕᒪOᗩK	Is it just usually a hub?
2020-02-19 21:53:43	yyyyy	traditionally I've seen hubs mentioned but the center of the star just needs to be a device that transmits traffic, I suppose
2020-02-19 21:53:44	Vent	does anyone have a good book on the design of compilers?
2020-02-19 21:53:46	Vent	or article
2020-02-19 21:53:49	Vent	either is fine
2020-02-19 21:54:09	yyyyy	hubs/switches
2020-02-19 21:54:21	yyyyy	Sorry, it shouldn't exclusively be a hub in the center
2020-02-19 21:54:40	yyyyy	Just know that a hub in the middle of a ⭐ topology will act differently than a switch
2020-02-19 21:54:54	yyyyy	@Hez Would you want to move to east coast?
2020-02-19 21:55:15	ᑕᒪOᗩK	@yyyyy  I'm taking notes so will I just note down ```The central device in a star topology is anything that transmits traffic e.g Routers , Modems , Switches , Hubs . However Hubs are the devices mostly used in the middle ```

2020-02-19 21:58:07	Hez	And yeah, kinda. On one hand it's fun to have a change, but on the other hand when you stay one place too long you don't want to leave cause you leave shit behind

2020-02-20 07:26:08	ABigPickle	"Hi, a student was involved in attempting to breach our security" yadadada you're suspended
2020-02-20 07:26:29	Swayella	why what he did had nothing to do with his school
2020-02-20 07:26:33	Swayella	stupid
2020-02-20 07:27:43	ABigPickle	He found a bug in some random software for schools that had nothing to do with his school?
2020-02-20 07:28:13	HexF	its mostly cloud based, and you can download databases
2020-02-20 07:28:26	ABigPickle	In that case, I suppose there's not much they could say
2020-02-20 07:29:10	Sporeo	if they do anything, lawyer up
2020-02-20 07:29:15	HexF	the worst i could do is breach privacy
2020-02-20 07:29:42	HexF	but even then they patched it up instantly
2020-02-20 07:30:20	HexF	(some endpoint didn't require authentication to download a copy of the database)
2020-02-20 07:30:29	HexF	EDIT: (some endpoint didn't require authentication to download a copy of the database, even tho auth was passed to it)

2020-02-20 07:31:52	HexF	but even then, my school kind of knows me for breaking things

2020-02-20 10:30:57	<--	Lachlan (Lachlan@discord) has left #general ()
2020-02-20 10:31:10	longears	Neat. Rarely, depends on the meeting.
2020-02-20 10:31:25	Valar_Morghulis	if so and you like red, try the 2017 chloe pinot noir
2020-02-20 10:31:36	Valar_Morghulis	its a very nice wine. no botterness

2020-02-20 10:32:29	longears	Will, do thanks :) I do like dry reds. I think the last one I had was a few months ago and it was 2006 Australian wine.
2020-02-20 10:33:28	Valar_Morghulis	the 2016 francis coppola noir is another great wine. again lacks the bitterness though

2020-02-20 10:35:01	longears	I think I thought a wine from Australia for the first time, so figured I'd give it a try. Especially since we had an event in a wine tasting room at a restaurant.
2020-02-20 10:35:44	longears	I think before that I had wine... Like 5 years ago? Can't even remember when or what it was.
