2020-02-18 11:22:40	PoorTheodore	[2020-02-12 02:08:18] fuckin hell that flag for bribery
2020-02-18 11:22:40	PoorTheodore	[2020-02-12 02:08:53] i thought i fucked up cause i thought "no way the flag is *that*"
2020-02-18 11:22:40	CMinusMinus	[2020-02-12 02:12:15] one of those huh?
2020-02-18 11:22:40	PoorTheodore	[2020-02-12 02:13:15] nah i meant what the flag actually says lmao
2020-02-18 11:22:40	toxic_|_пират	[2020-02-12 15:51:17] are the web ctf's down again?
2020-02-18 11:22:40	uriel	[2020-02-12 19:08:23] anyone here with some crypto skills?
2020-02-18 11:22:40	uriel	[2020-02-12 19:08:23]
2020-02-18 11:22:40	uriel	[2020-02-12 19:08:23] stcwi.ne xj jxvg pdfz pijfxks.

2020-02-18 11:22:40	uriel	[2020-02-12 19:08:23] supposed to be a piece of cake type of challenge, but already burned a lot of time on it
2020-02-18 11:22:40	uriel	[2020-02-12 19:08:30] any hints?
2020-02-18 11:22:40	uriel	[2020-02-12 19:08:34] ideas?
2020-02-18 11:22:40	toxic_|_пират	[2020-02-12 19:19:36] might be ROT
2020-02-18 11:22:40	uriel	[2020-02-12 19:20:05] 1st thing I've tried 😉
2020-02-18 11:22:40	delta	[2020-02-12 19:49:39] Stop with the wink, anyway i'd sugest trying to map characters to letters. Looking at the text xj seems to apear twice so its unlikely the 'key' changes and there are few 2 letter words in the english alphabet. That or this is a chiper im unfamiliar with
2020-02-18 11:22:40	toxic_|_пират	[2020-02-12 22:46:58] web ctf's still down :peepoDetective: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/570300270089732096.png>
2020-02-18 11:22:40	Svelteٴ	[2020-02-12 22:47:04] yup
2020-02-18 11:22:40	CMinusMinus	[2020-02-13 02:09:05] @uriel That looks like nested crypto
2020-02-18 11:22:40	CMinusMinus	[2020-02-13 02:10:03] The pattern, the 3rd line has characters in different case and number. Which means the proceeding portion is what you solve first. You solve that the 3rd line will still look like garbage, but it'll be in a point where you can convert it into something else
2020-02-18 11:22:40	CMinusMinus	[2020-02-13 02:10:07] maybe base 64
2020-02-18 11:22:40	CMinusMinus	[2020-02-13 02:33:26] also the setcwi.ne makes me think of a two character top level domain. Like it's referring to a place to convert the string
2020-02-18 11:22:40	CMinusMinus	[2020-02-13 02:35:46] Also the xj, xj repeated means it's likely a repeated substitution rather than a cipher that cycles through replacement
2020-02-18 11:22:40	_Little_Mango_	[2020-02-13 04:39:28] So for the ctf truck stop, I ||put it through a program to extract text from it, look through it with photoshop (layers and colours), and I also tried stegsolve|| I have yet to find anything
2020-02-18 11:22:40	toxic_|_пират	[2020-02-13 12:45:22] @>.<_Little_Mango_>.< stegsolve is the right path
2020-02-18 11:22:40	toxic_|_пират	[2020-02-13 12:47:46] although you could also solve it with notepad
2020-02-18 11:22:40	_Little_Mango_	[2020-02-13 15:22:43] tyty
2020-02-18 11:22:40	CMinusMinus	[2020-02-13 19:27:16] Don't over think it @>.<_Little_Mango_>.<
2020-02-18 11:22:40	_Little_Mango_	[2020-02-14 00:50:55] @.toxic_|_пират
2020-02-18 11:22:40	_Little_Mango_	[2020-02-14 00:51:06] can't find shit
2020-02-18 11:22:40	_Little_Mango_	[2020-02-14 00:52:00] I ||tried finding it in notepad and I can't, I put it through the stego.jar and didnt find anything||
2020-02-18 11:22:40	_Little_Mango_	[2020-02-14 00:52:03] gosh
2020-02-18 11:22:40	ABigPickle	[2020-02-14 01:23:18] @>.<_Little_Mango_>.< ||all I can say is since he said it's solvable with notepad, think of where information is usually hidden in that case if it's an image||
2020-02-18 11:22:40	_Little_Mango_	[2020-02-14 01:27:02] @ABigPickle I made it into a ||.txt and found all of the binary and stuff but no flag||
2020-02-18 11:22:40	ABigPickle	[2020-02-14 01:30:04] ||just look through it in text form, look at the locations where something usually is. once you find it you'll be like ohhhhh||
2020-02-18 11:22:40	_Little_Mango_	[2020-02-14 01:40:38] alright
2020-02-18 11:22:40	Shikata	[2020-02-14 02:34:41] @>.<_Little_Mango_>.< maybe metadata
2020-02-18 11:22:40	Unfunny	[2020-02-14 03:55:28] oog oooog is there a way to reset profile for lhc ctf?
2020-02-18 11:22:40	ABigPickle	[2020-02-14 04:51:04] why
2020-02-18 11:22:40	Unfunny	[2020-02-14 05:10:31] im ranked around 150th
2020-02-18 11:22:40	Unfunny	[2020-02-14 05:10:44] i ain't got me dank roles
2020-02-18 11:22:40	ABigPickle	[2020-02-14 05:13:12] Not sure if it's related but if you look in #ctf-solves the bot doesn't seem to update score since like last week, perhaps it has to do with cert issue? just shooting off ideas at this point
2020-02-18 11:22:40	Unfunny	[2020-02-14 05:14:34] /me sad otter noises
2020-02-18 11:22:40	ABigPickle	[2020-02-14 05:14:51] you'll get your role eventually
2020-02-18 11:22:40	v01dwalk-	[2020-02-14 19:17:11] Wait it hasn’t been fixed yet?
2020-02-18 11:22:40	||UsedDiscord||	[2020-02-14 21:30:43] Execuse me, but how open file .bin? xD

2020-02-18 11:22:40	Lord_Arjuna	[2020-02-16 07:45:17] it can be edited on a text editor
2020-02-18 11:22:40	Noodles	[2020-02-16 11:30:58] or executed
2020-02-18 11:22:40	Noodles	[2020-02-16 11:30:59] i think
2020-02-18 11:22:40	Noodles	[2020-02-16 11:31:11] but mostly i've had to read bins
2020-02-18 11:22:40	CMinusMinus	[2020-02-16 21:46:27] I feel like i'm missing something obvious in Baby Mama Trauma. Can I hit someone up in a DM to walk through my line of thinking?
