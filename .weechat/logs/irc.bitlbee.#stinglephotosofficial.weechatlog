2020-02-24 10:55:02	CharlesMercier	[2020-02-18 20:09:20] I'm experiencing difficulties with low light settings for photos. Without flash, they turn completely black in Single while being relatively descent in safecamera and open camera in the exact same conditions. I see no settings that could help with this. Any idea?
