2020-02-19 09:19:05	suren	[2020-02-18 20:58:34] Rub do you by any chance know someone with a riseup account?
2020-02-19 09:19:05	suren	[2020-02-18 20:58:39] Привет
2020-02-19 09:19:05	RM	[2020-02-18 20:59:01] I don’t know what riseup is. :-)
2020-02-19 09:19:05	suren	[2020-02-18 21:00:37] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riseup
2020-02-19 09:19:05	suren	[2020-02-18 21:00:41] This riseup
2020-02-19 09:19:05	suren	[2020-02-18 21:00:51] They require an invite code from a member to register
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:23:33] Look it’s the first time I hear about them.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:23:51] And I have strong distrust to any invite only
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:24:04] And anything quasi-secret.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:25:47] I think invite only principle is really worth it for organisations like this
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:26:06] Nope.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:26:33] The more secretive a service is, the more things can be stuffed there.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:26:42] It’s like honeypot
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:27:05] It's fully open sourced tho
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:27:16] And I don't think it's to keep the secrecy
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:27:25] How will you check it?
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:27:34] I mean the code integrity.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:27:37] More to keep the spam away without using captchas like Google's
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:28:06] But captcha is cheap and secure enough.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:28:29] Their main purpose is to be privacy oriented
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:28:36] And invites are pushing back the users
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:28:36] Hence Google is a no-go
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:28:51]

2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:28:51] Not people who really belong to that community
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:29:38] Let’s go to the point: how invites are increasing the privacy?
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:29:53] You need to open up to someone, right?
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:30:13] I mean that someone will need to open up to you too.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:30:36] Do you are leaving real life trace to get access.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:31:19] A friend is meant to invite you there
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:31:42] A friend is meant to sell you to cops.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:31:44] So he is the only one to know about you there
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:32:03] There no friends when you need privacy.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:32:18] Literally - no.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:32:34] Well then how else do you create a privacy oriented free platform and manage to maintain a valid userbase
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:32:41] With no bots and spam
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:33:04] It’s a topic for a long discussion.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:33:26] But short answer is TOR, wickr, i2p
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:34:33] Definitely.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:34:46] But you also need a mail and a VPN
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:34:56] Well
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:35:01] I2P
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:35:02] You can self host a mail
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:35:14] And then any other mail.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:35:27] Whonix/tails - is a good exam
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:35:33] Example
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:36:18] Will read up on that
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:36:27] Also found a decent vpn
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:36:35] Mullvad
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:36:48] It’s good
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:36:55] My backup option
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:37:00] If proton fails
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:38:20] I have some concerns about proton's privacy
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:38:26] Well mainly their jurisdiction
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:39:43] Switzerland has to cooperate with the 14 eyes right?
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:41:37] Only for the cases of financial transparency, AFAIK.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:42:54] I don't know
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:43:11] The TOS of their mail has really questionable points
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:43:20] So I tend not to like their vpn
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:44:29] You have the free options: i2p and TOR
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:44:52] As in tor as vpn?
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:45:08] Yup.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:46:54] Aren't most of tor's end nodes controlled by the NSA?
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:48:04] Noone knows for sure. :-)
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:48:39] You can expect, that every exit node for every VPN is controlled by NSA.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:48:51] :-)
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:49:03] It's always a trade-off.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 22:49:23] And there's no such thing like a complete, total security
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 22:50:28] I'm saying this just based on the Snowden leaks
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 23:00:45] Any source for this?
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 23:01:41] IIRC Snowden have told that there were experiments on the territory of US with increasing number of controlled exit nodes.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 23:02:08] But I'm not sure about "all"
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 23:03:18] No not all definitely
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 23:04:05]

2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 23:06:02] The very feature that makes Tor a powerful anonymity service, and the fact that all Tor users look alike on the internet, makes it easy to differentiate Tor users from other web users. On the other hand, the anonymity provided by Tor makes it impossible for the NSA to know who the user is, or whether or not the user is in the US.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 23:06:02]
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 23:06:02] After identifying an individual Tor user on the internet, the NSA uses its network of secret internet servers to redirect those users to another set of secret internet servers, with the codename FoxAcid, to infect the user's computer. FoxAcid is an NSA system designed to act as a matchmaker between potential targets and attacks developed by the NSA, giving the agency opportunity to launch prepared attacks against their
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 23:06:02] systems.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 23:06:29] It's an approach to hack client.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 23:09:28] Guess so
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 23:09:57] WHy guess? There's a direct quotation in your link.
2020-02-19 09:19:52	RM	[2020-02-18 23:10:01] :)
2020-02-19 09:19:52	suren	[2020-02-18 23:14:18] Fair enough
