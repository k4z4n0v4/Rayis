2020-02-18 10:13:38	suren	was wondering if you have your terminal's bell turned on and whether or not mentions in bitlbee trigger that bell
2020-02-18 10:14:32	longears	Ah. I don't think it's on. I never turned it off, I think it's just silent by the default. Not sure why.
2020-02-18 10:16:27	suren	i see, will tinker with it more 
2020-02-18 10:16:38	suren	thanks a bunch
