2020-02-18 18:50:40	suren	Wanted to know if you've done htb nest by any chance
2020-02-18 18:50:53	Waffles	Nah, haven't messed with HTB in a fat minute
2020-02-18 18:51:05	suren	Dem
2020-02-18 18:51:24	suren	Have never been 1 step away from root for 3 hours
2020-02-18 19:00:49	Waffles	I mean I might be able to give ideas
2020-02-18 19:01:07	suren	damn its a long, connected box 
2020-02-18 19:01:07	ℹ 	[Waffles] is away: Offline
2020-02-18 19:01:18	suren	its gonna be hard to retell it all
2020-02-18 19:01:26	Waffles	Oh like Ghoul was?
2020-02-18 19:02:01	Waffles	I need to start doing HTB again, I've just been more interested in dev recently idk
2020-02-18 19:06:00	suren	i got hard on htb recently 
2020-02-18 19:06:08	suren	managing to do more and more boxes
2020-02-18 19:06:15	suren	fun :smile:
2020-02-18 19:06:59	Waffles	Yeah it feels good lol. I think one of the most satisfying things for me was taking down my first 50 pointer with no help
2020-02-18 19:07:14	Waffles	It was fortune which was the easiest 50 pointer ever but still
2020-02-18 19:07:28	suren	havent seen that box 
2020-02-18 19:07:35	suren	time to watch some ippsec
2020-02-18 19:08:31	Waffles	It's retired and wasn't as cool as like Kryptos or as much of a brainfuck as Rope but it was still fun
2020-02-18 19:08:47	suren	oh rope is in my todo list 
2020-02-18 19:09:53	Waffles	Rope really pushed me on my binary exploitation abilities, was probably the most interesting box in that realm
