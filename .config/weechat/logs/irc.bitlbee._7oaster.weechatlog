2020-03-13 17:16:23	_7oaster	Yo
2020-03-13 17:16:38	suren	how are you doing?
2020-03-13 17:16:56	_7oaster	Good, tired af but good
2020-03-13 17:17:44	suren	so i came with a question
2020-03-13 17:17:49	suren	maybe a strange one
2020-03-13 17:17:58	suren	say i wanna become a PI
2020-03-13 17:18:11	suren	how do i work towards that?
2020-03-13 17:19:13	_7oaster	Well its different for every province/state. Youre from Onterrible right?
2020-03-13 17:19:38	suren	im not even in canada actually
2020-03-13 17:19:55	suren	what if we dont dig into the legal stuff
2020-03-13 17:20:03	suren	talk knowledge and skills
2020-03-13 17:20:11	_7oaster	Lol I must be confusing you with someone else then.
2020-03-13 17:20:29	_7oaster	First you need to know how the legal systems work, thats a big one
2020-03-13 17:21:08	_7oaster	Also, writing skills are very important as your notes are admissable in court. Report writing is a must as well
2020-03-13 17:21:42	_7oaster	You really have to know the laws too. Especially privacy laws and trespassing laws
2020-03-13 17:21:48	suren	have a very close  judge friend, can help me out with those
2020-03-13 17:22:08	_7oaster	Perfect yeah
2020-03-13 17:22:35	_7oaster	Practice remebering details, like memory recall
2020-03-13 17:23:21	_7oaster	Surveillance skills will all come later, you basically just need to blend in and not be seen
2020-03-13 17:25:30	_7oaster	first you will probably need to do a course, then exams, then paperwork and fingerprinting, then apply for the license, then start working as a PI. Although youll need to research that becuase the proccess is different for each state
2020-03-13 17:26:20	_7oaster	Also, piss jugs are a must have when conducting surveillance ðŸ˜‚
2020-03-13 17:26:32	suren	lol
2020-03-13 17:26:36	suren	might have guessed
2020-03-13 17:26:59	suren	what about the IT related parts?
2020-03-13 17:27:17	_7oaster	OSINT skills are a must have,
2020-03-13 17:28:18	_7oaster	Also OPSEC is important, try to dox yourself online and start hiding your ass
2020-03-13 17:28:53	_7oaster	Because people will try and dox you,
2020-03-13 17:29:24	_7oaster	Basic IT skills are good too,
2020-03-13 17:29:27	suren	was considering bazzell's book on that
2020-03-13 17:30:16	_7oaster	Yeah its a good read, just practice OSINT however you can. Try and dox some random people you know
2020-03-13 17:30:32	suren	currently what im doing
2020-03-13 17:31:40	_7oaster	Its fun haha
