2020-03-12 09:48:06	Kiro47	[09:14:09] Had to stop because fucking internet.
2020-03-12 09:48:06	Kiro47	[09:14:21] I literally have been unable to work on it for 3 hours now
2020-03-12 09:48:06	HackerTheCat	[09:16:56] Need help?
2020-03-12 09:48:06	HackerTheCat	[09:17:15] https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/564925054765367296/687529623122345984/unknown.png
2020-03-12 09:48:06	HackerTheCat	[09:17:29] As luck would have it I literally just built a CTFd server.
2020-03-12 09:48:06	Kiro47	[09:18:39] Kek, easy todo
2020-03-12 09:48:06	Kiro47	[09:19:35] Tbh, one of the things that needs to be done on the side is just making a web page for handling configuration stuff. As an addition to the config file.
2020-03-12 09:48:06	Kiro47	[09:20:15] The main stuff I'd offer, but can't push to you right now because half of the DB work can't be pushed because of internet.
2020-03-12 09:48:06	Kiro47	[09:21:28] The critical stuff to actually make it work is almost done, but stuck locally atm.
2020-03-12 09:48:06	Kiro47	[09:27:22] So if anyone wants to hit that up :peepoFingerGuns: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/606725219771482134.png>
2020-03-12 09:48:06	HackerTheCat	[09:28:18] Define "configuration stuff"?
2020-03-12 09:48:06	Kiro47	[09:29:49] Simplicity in what I said
2020-03-12 09:48:06	Kiro47	[09:30:15] Legit just need a webpage that can load in configuration options for the plugin

2020-03-12 09:48:06	HackerTheCat	[09:35:32] I assume it has a lot of customization to do the Discord auth, etc?
2020-03-12 09:48:06	Kiro47	[09:35:49] The plugin yes, the web page no
2020-03-12 09:48:06	Kiro47	[09:36:09] Just needs to be a basic template to load the values for the plugin to use

2020-03-12 18:24:49	_7oaster	d be down for teaching an OSINT course, I love that shit
2020-03-12 18:24:52	CMinusMinus	As long as it is self sustaining so roots and sudos don't have more work on their hands. Maybe lay down a few ground rules and have a contingency for people who cause problems in voice or are disruptive? Teacher role has some power to boot form VC or have a root available for those things
2020-03-12 18:24:58	_7oaster	EDIT: I'd be down for teaching an OSINT course, I love that shit
2020-03-12 18:25:23	CMinusMinus	I enjoy teaching people critical thinking when it comes to CTF and puzzle solving. Maybe core concepts on how to approach security.
2020-03-12 18:25:43	CMinusMinus	Maybe some Networking basics
2020-03-12 18:25:57	Lowebrew	hmmmm, you mean write out policies and guidelines? *drools*
2020-03-12 18:26:13	Grey-Man	id be down for OSINT, theres always tools out there I havnt heard about

2020-03-12 18:28:58	_7oaster	Just have a muted channel set for a specific time. Then open the channel for a few a bit for questions. Used to do it all the time on IRC
2020-03-12 18:29:27	Grey-Man	Looking at it now, it does everything except for pass's?
2020-03-12 18:29:42	_7oaster	DeHashed recently made all the dumps uncencored, but yeah, WLI was better because it usually yielded more results

2020-03-14 00:52:06	Lowebrew	they never removed me
2020-03-14 00:52:12	ser3n1ty	Lol
2020-03-14 00:52:44	RedWedge	My company said "If your job allows you to work from home and you have that ability, do so" but hasn't made it mandatory yet.
2020-03-14 00:53:05	Lowebrew	we are doing a wfh test monday
2020-03-14 00:53:13	Lowebrew	so we may go mando wfh soon
2020-03-14 00:53:17	ser3n1ty	some of the emails are hilarious ive seen like "our company will still be functioning but everything will be remote from our company minus X things" "ok, you guys never even had a brick and mortar store, so who the fuck cares"
2020-03-14 00:53:39	RedWedge	We were supposed to do a WFH stress test today, but like three hours after they announced that, they changed it to "eh, everyone just go ahead until further notice"
2020-03-14 00:53:53	Lowebrew	lol
2020-03-14 00:54:00	ser3n1ty	we pretty much already work remote anyways so :shrug: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/621790041915654155.png>
2020-03-14 00:54:04	ser3n1ty	at least in my division
2020-03-14 00:54:16	RedWedge	Jokes on them though, pretty much everyone I work with is at other offices, so I'm pretty isolated in my office anyway.
2020-03-14 00:54:17	Lowebrew	oh jeez, do you guys have VPNs at each location, or centralized? @RedWedge
2020-03-14 00:54:38	ser3n1ty	literally the only difference for me right now is that my boss is like "shit now I cant make you come into the office if I want you to" lol
2020-03-14 00:54:59	ser3n1ty	he never makes us come in anyways so :shrug: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/621790041915654155.png>
2020-03-14 00:55:02	Lowebrew	my office is 70ish peeps, our VPN supports 500, so I doubt we will have issues lol
2020-03-14 00:55:19	RedWedge	mostly centralized corp infra. We're fine.
2020-03-14 00:55:28	Lowebrew	yea, buyt thats a pain still
2020-03-14 00:55:40	RedWedge	I mean, not really. I work from home pretty often anyway.
2020-03-14 00:55:55	Lowebrew	I mean, if you guys ALL go wfh
2020-03-14 00:56:08	Lowebrew	that can cause bandwidth issues if no all hashed out right
2020-03-14 00:56:18	RedWedge	Our boss' philosophy is "act like an adult" and "if you work from home, actually be available and do work. Hell, be MORE available and responsive than normal"
2020-03-14 00:56:27	RedWedge	Our corp infra can handle it.
2020-03-14 00:56:33	Lowebrew	yea, I believe that
2020-03-14 00:56:52	Svelteٴ	You actually have to tell working adults to be adults?
2020-03-14 00:56:55	Lowebrew	hmmmm, do you know if you guys are running any SD-WASs?
2020-03-14 00:57:03	Lowebrew	SD-WANs*
2020-03-14 00:57:18	Lowebrew	been a pain finding proper orgs running them
2020-03-14 00:57:24	RedWedge	We have a lot of newgrads on their first job. Gotta get them to understand things explicitly.
2020-03-14 00:58:08	HackerTheCat	I need some Winders ideas... I have a laptop that gets about 60-80 Mbit no matter what on ethernet or 5G wifi.
2020-03-14 00:58:18	HackerTheCat	Other device son the network get 250+ mbit.
2020-03-14 00:58:35	Lowebrew	turn it off and on again?
2020-03-14 00:58:38	HackerTheCat	I've tried usb 3.0 adapters, 5g wifi.
2020-03-14 00:58:39	Lowebrew	screamed at it?
2020-03-14 00:58:47	HackerTheCat	All those things, done...

2020-03-14 00:59:20	HackerTheCat	@ser3n1ty it came pre-yeeted from HP
2020-03-14 00:59:21	ser3n1ty	some routers have QoS stuff
2020-03-14 00:59:23	ser3n1ty	damn
2020-03-14 00:59:31	HackerTheCat	@ser3n1ty Ah, yeah, nothing like that.
2020-03-14 00:59:43	HackerTheCat	Again, this is the ONLY device doing this.
2020-03-14 01:00:01	ser3n1ty	yoink it from the network

2020-03-14 01:02:54	HackerTheCat	Yep
2020-03-14 01:03:00	HackerTheCat	even laptop to modem is the same results.
2020-03-14 01:03:40	HackerTheCat	Plug a different laptop into the cable, boom full speed.
2020-03-14 01:03:55	ser3n1ty	wat wifi card
2020-03-14 01:04:02	ser3n1ty	wait
2020-03-14 01:04:04	ser3n1ty	nvm
2020-03-14 01:04:07	HackerTheCat	It has to be a windows issue?
2020-03-14 01:04:10	RedWedge	MAC or IP conflict?
2020-03-14 01:04:25	HackerTheCat	No, not on ethernet and WiFi red.
2020-03-14 01:04:31	ser3n1ty	wouldnt be a MAC conflict IIRC
2020-03-14 01:05:08	ser3n1ty	what laptop
2020-03-14 01:05:17	RedWedge	not on wifi, based on collision domain seperation, and I guess yeah, the same on most home/SOHO routers.

2020-03-14 01:05:28	RedWedge	But IP conflict can cause some show shit.

2020-03-14 01:05:49	HackerTheCat	i7, 16 GB RAM etc.

2020-03-14 01:09:10	ser3n1ty	because itd be testing the VM from another machine
2020-03-14 01:09:25	ser3n1ty	if you can get a VM on your PC though, id recommend doing that and testing the speeds

2020-03-14 04:08:18	voltamage	the weird `sed '/history | grep/d'` is to exclude my own command, and the `sed 's/:amd64//'` is to get rid of extraneous information and just have the package names
2020-03-14 04:08:26	voltamage	so the comparison works
