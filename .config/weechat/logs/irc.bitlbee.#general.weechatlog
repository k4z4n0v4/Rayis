2020-03-12 09:48:02	SinisterMatrix	[08:27:45] Our internet bill costs so much cause where I live there is really only one provider
2020-03-12 09:48:02	Regina_George	[08:27:58] Also, TOM HANKS HAS CORONAVIRUS
2020-03-12 09:48:02	Kiro47	[08:29:26] Most people only have one provider tbh
2020-03-12 09:48:02	ser3n1ty	[08:30:21] we have a few out here I think
2020-03-12 09:48:02	ser3n1ty	[08:30:28] cox is the best one out here though
2020-03-12 09:48:02	SinisterMatrix	[08:31:08] Yeah no options really which sucks cause they can shill you an arm and a leg for crappy service
2020-03-12 09:48:02	ser3n1ty	[08:33:51] yep out here we have relatively good service because everyone else is shit
2020-03-12 09:48:02	HackerTheCat	[08:36:32] @Kiro47 that latency is very nice.
2020-03-12 09:48:02	HackerTheCat	[08:36:40] I ran 10 tests thats about average every time.
2020-03-12 09:48:02	Kiro47	[08:37:18] That's better latency than what I get over powerline. Damn
2020-03-12 09:48:02	HackerTheCat	[08:37:38] Once the constellation is complete I'd expect it to be faster, too.
2020-03-12 09:48:02	HackerTheCat	[08:38:47] Actually, should prob delete that. I didn't consider it might violate some NDA.

2020-03-12 12:20:32	Shikata	Pretty cool
2020-03-12 12:21:00	Shikata	Maybe commission an artist to make your own personalized one
2020-03-12 12:22:05	Im_A_Fan	I could, but that seems like something a weeb would do, so probably not
2020-03-12 12:22:25	Shikata	Meh...liking a piece of art doesnt make u a weeb
2020-03-12 12:24:00	Im_A_Fan	no, but 3/4ths of the artists on the internet just draw anime type things
2020-03-12 12:24:58	Shikata	Whether that point is true or not...I would find an artist that had an artstyle I liked and commision them and use that photo as reference lol

So don't stop learning and improving performance, but don't get upset because something can be done better. Just be glad you learned it and now you found a way to make something better. Don't stress about it, because you've done it in the first place.

2020-03-12 18:14:22	zer0_c00l	i remember you saying something about a contract for wifi throughout an entire building?
2020-03-12 18:15:33	ObjectiveAct	I’m trying to learn more web app exploits, but don’t know where to continue where I am... I need something sort of basic as I’m not that skilled, but not stuff like... the complete basics
2020-03-12 18:15:43	longears	Ah, yeah. On East Coast? It never went beyond that. We really need to rethink our approach of tracking workforce. Then we can apply for more contracts like that easier.
2020-03-12 18:16:14	longears	@ObjectiveAct I see. I normally avoid web stuff as much as possible :D
2020-03-12 18:16:24	ObjectiveAct	Like maybe having to get more technical with stuff, like using burp and maybe some other things to find exploits
2020-03-12 18:21:09	longears	I wish I could help, but I'm afraid I'm not that much into web.
2020-03-12 18:21:50	ObjectiveAct	I get it
2020-03-12 18:22:10	ObjectiveAct	That’s why I recommended the mentor program... cause I can’t find mentors anywhere I go...
2020-03-12 18:23:09	ObjectiveAct	Only things I find are $1 a minute mentor!!!
2020-03-12 18:23:12	ObjectiveAct	And I’m like

2020-03-13 11:57:01	babyface_batman	there are a lot of false accusations
2020-03-13 11:57:20	babyface_batman	because there is no punishment for the person who makes the accusation
2020-03-13 11:57:22	babyface_batman	it sucks tbh

2020-03-13 12:44:14	Regina_George	[12:18:28] @Sporeo I don't know I'm good about picking through some stuff like that but that guy literally made a throw away and he seems pretty defensive
2020-03-13 12:44:14	Regina_George	[12:20:11] Plus this stuff actually is pretty common and I think a lot of people would like to believe it's fake because confronting the fact that people like this exist is hard for them to do.
2020-03-13 12:44:14	Sporeo	[12:20:13] Ya ya, wasn't saying that specific story but in general
2020-03-13 12:44:14	Regina_George	[12:20:25] Oh yeah I know I know what you're saying
2020-03-13 12:44:14	babyface_batman	[12:20:28] @nnnnn u just changed your pfp but I love the one u had it as, it's such a cool photoshoot
2020-03-13 12:44:14	Regina_George	[12:20:32] I actually just had someone in another server accused it of being fake
2020-03-13 12:44:14	nnnnn	[12:20:42] @babyface_batman want the images?
2020-03-13 12:44:14	babyface_batman	[12:20:49] nah I've got the source art
2020-03-13 12:44:14	babyface_batman	[12:20:56] it's a really cool set tho I love it
2020-03-13 12:44:14	nnnnn	[12:21:03] Yeah
2020-03-13 12:44:14	Regina_George	[12:21:04] Their rationale for it being fake was that every comment agreed that the OP was an asshole
2020-03-13 12:44:14	nnnnn	[12:21:06] I have more like it
2020-03-13 12:44:14	Regina_George	[12:21:20] Which kind of annoyed me because that's not really a proper metric to base that statement on
2020-03-13 12:44:14	babyface_batman	[12:21:23] the artist has done some really cool stuff with skulls and roses
2020-03-13 12:44:14	Sporeo	[12:21:37] I believe someone would and could do that to a dog because I see that type of behavior a lot :WhatTheFUG: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/303254641850843148.png>
2020-03-13 12:44:14	Regina_George	[12:21:54] I'm glad I had normal fucking parents
2020-03-13 12:44:14	Regina_George	[12:22:02] But I do know a lot of narcissist and I feel bad for their kids
2020-03-13 12:44:14	algiuxas	[12:28:34] Basically I have a Linux server (with virtualgl), I want to Livestream on it to YouTube without obs, but with node.js (from canvas/web-page). Any ideas?
2020-03-13 12:44:14	algiuxas	[12:29:51] Nevermind, found something https://github.com/fbsamples/Canvas-Streaming-Example
2020-03-13 12:44:14	Regina_George	[12:39:27] @v01dwalk- Yo
2020-03-13 12:44:14	Regina_George	[12:40:10] Imagine if a digruntled employee used Gremlin to take down a company's entire stack
2020-03-13 12:44:14	Regina_George	[12:40:36] Or some sort of chaos testing tool

2020-03-13 12:53:16	ser3n1ty	@Regina_George that thread is kinda fucked
2020-03-13 12:53:33	Regina_George	@ser3n1ty yeah it really is
2020-03-13 12:53:40	ser3n1ty	im not super against dogs being put down for their well-being, but it seems like this dude was a fucking moron
2020-03-13 12:53:59	Regina_George	Oh I don't think he was a moron at all
2020-03-13 12:54:10	Regina_George	I think he was a controlling and manipulative piece of shit
2020-03-13 12:54:16	nnnnn	:monkaGIGA: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/569352842566172714.png>
2020-03-13 12:54:54	ser3n1ty	hes kinda a moron if hes saying that its not about the money then stating that he cant justify spending that much on the dog
2020-03-13 12:55:00	ser3n1ty	hes definitely an asshole though
2020-03-13 12:55:02	Regina_George	I'll trade ya that I can agree with
2020-03-13 12:55:08	Regina_George	EDIT: Ok ya that I can agree with
2020-03-13 12:55:14	Aeterne	Gosh
2020-03-13 12:55:18	Aeterne	can someone unban me
2020-03-13 12:55:43	Regina_George	My mom has some narcissistic tendencies but like she's not nearly this bad and she actually tries to check herself on some things
2020-03-13 12:55:54	Aeterne	@v01dwalk- Hey
2020-03-13 12:56:01	ser3n1ty	I dont have any ill wishes for the dude, but he needs to grow the fuck up and realize that animals/pets are more than just a fucking object
2020-03-13 12:56:07	Aeterne	Got a little problem with the invite link
2020-03-13 12:56:07	Regina_George	But it was still kind of hard going up with it
2020-03-13 12:56:16	Aeterne	it says I'm banned even though I'm here
2020-03-13 12:56:39	Regina_George	Getting gaslit from a narcissistic person is the worst
2020-03-13 12:57:09	ser3n1ty	like my animals, if SHTF I would have to ditch, and may or may not feel anything for them, but if theyre injured and shit... you should at least try to save them (at the recommendation of a certified vet)
2020-03-13 12:57:37	Regina_George	I understand that completely but like I don't know I would probably go to more links that are probably safe for my dog
2020-03-13 12:57:41	ser3n1ty	he literally said the dog already "fulfilled its purpose"
2020-03-13 12:57:44	ser3n1ty	thats so fucked up
2020-03-13 12:57:45	White_Rose	Heyo
2020-03-13 12:57:47	Aeterne	I like hacking but it tends to be kinda boring ig
2020-03-13 12:57:47	Regina_George	And I know it's completely irrational but that's just me
2020-03-13 12:58:04	ser3n1ty	what do you mean boring?
2020-03-13 12:58:16	ser3n1ty	I mean at least 80% of my pentesting is just reading documentation
2020-03-13 12:58:23	ser3n1ty	but thats still fun imo
2020-03-13 12:58:36	Aeterne	Well the *not* boring stuff is often illegal so
2020-03-13 12:58:44	ser3n1ty	fals
2020-03-13 12:58:56	White_Rose	> it says I'm banned even though I'm here
2020-03-13 12:58:56	White_Rose	@Aeterne ye its not about u, its been happening to many discord links lately
2020-03-13 12:58:56	Regina_George	Why would you come in and derail a conversation like that
2020-03-13 12:59:02	Aeterne	ah okay
2020-03-13 12:59:06	Aeterne	haha
2020-03-13 12:59:15	Aeterne	I'm just wondering if you can prove me wrong
2020-03-13 12:59:22	ser3n1ty	id have to say though, that people on reddit always overreact
2020-03-13 12:59:26	Regina_George	I'm calling it now this kids going to get a dumb roll
2020-03-13 12:59:38	White_Rose	BRAH I SAW RED IN MY DREAM
2020-03-13 12:59:46	ser3n1ty	they always end up death threating people who hate animals, etc
2020-03-13 12:59:48	Regina_George	@ser3n1ty yeah that's a little overboard
2020-03-13 12:59:54	ser3n1ty	@Aeterne I can, theres this thing called red teaming
2020-03-13 12:59:57	Aeterne	what do you guys consider fun in hacking?
2020-03-13 13:00:03	ser3n1ty	some of the most fun ive ever done
2020-03-13 13:00:05	Aeterne	oh yea ig that's cool
2020-03-13 13:00:14	Aeterne	but I mean something you can do on your own
2020-03-13 13:00:14	White_Rose	do u like solving problems
2020-03-13 13:00:17	Aeterne	I DO
2020-03-13 13:00:19	Aeterne	a lot
2020-03-13 13:00:31	White_Rose	Ok do u like finding flaws
2020-03-13 13:00:34	Aeterne	useful problems though
2020-03-13 13:00:35	ser3n1ty	you can red team on your own. its a hard challenge, but if you wanted to, you could
2020-03-13 13:00:39	Aeterne	really depends
2020-03-13 13:00:44	ser3n1ty	research is really cool too
2020-03-13 13:00:55	Aeterne	if they allow me to achieve something afterwards ig
2020-03-13 13:01:02	ser3n1ty	imagine trying weird ass shit with frequencies to bypass security measures
2020-03-13 13:01:03	Aeterne	if it's just a software bug or smth not really
2020-03-13 13:01:05	White_Rose	@𝓡𝓮𝓭~_⛧📿惡魔 i saw u in my dream where someone dared u to hack me:monkaGIGA: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/569352842566172714.png>

2020-03-13 13:04:47	ser3n1ty	on top of that, you have to have at least 3 years of full-time investigative work experience from a former employer (which means you have to do unpaid internships/education/training for 3 years)

2020-03-13 13:05:17	nnnnn	3 years unpaid
2020-03-13 13:05:20	Regina_George	That's also a thing

2020-03-13 13:05:37	Regina_George	Yeah but wouldn't investigative work in the military qualify
2020-03-13 13:05:42	White_Rose	3 years unpaid is better than 3 years with u payin a tuition in university
2020-03-13 13:05:47	ser3n1ty	im not sure
2020-03-13 13:05:52	ser3n1ty	it might
2020-03-13 13:05:54	nnnnn	Depends what type ig? @Regina_George
2020-03-13 13:06:13	ser3n1ty	but it depends on your job in the military, and youre not guaranteed your job when you enlist
2020-03-13 13:06:54	ser3n1ty	so if you do get into investigative work, sure, you could do that
2020-03-13 13:07:02	Regina_George	I want to expose people's Secrets like the stranger does
2020-03-13 13:07:52	ser3n1ty	I mean you do you lol
2020-03-13 13:09:09	Regina_George	I mean I'm never going to actually do that because it's a lot of work but I just like the whole vibe she's got

2020-03-14 04:28:22	Kiro47	The whole "says you're banned" on the invite links is some stupid discord shit. Sometimes their embeds like that break for certain user accounts due to some kind of caching issues.
2020-03-14 04:28:22	Kiro47	The link should work perfectly fine for those who haven't used it before, however.
